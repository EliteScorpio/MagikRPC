# MagikRPC
-- For the moment, MagikRPC needs a makeover, but this is already 1 preview. ---

MagikRPC is a Bot that lets you use remote commands to set various RPC statuses.

It's coded in JavaScript and requires several elements: not only is NodeJS required, but Administrator Rights (using a killer) and Discord Client are also required.

So you need to have the bot on your server, but you also need to have these files on your PC or in a place where you also have your Discord client, since an RPC can only act with the Discord Client.

It consists of several commands:

/enableRPC SoftwareName PatchFile Usage </br>
/changerRPC SoftwareName PatchUsage Usage </br>
/stopRPC </br>
/stopbot (This kills NodeJS) </br>
/infoMagik </br>
/info User or Server  </br>
